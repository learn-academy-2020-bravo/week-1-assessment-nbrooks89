# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: a function is a reusable piece of code takes in arguments and different datatypes to  preform a specific tasks.
  you would use a function to preform a task and be able to call on that task through out your code.

  Researched answer:a function is a javascript procedure that preforms a task or calculates a value. a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.

2. What is the difference between map and filter?
  Your answer:the difference between a map and a filter is a that a map calls on each index of an array and creates a new array that was the the same length of the original. A filter creates a new array with only specified indexes.


  Researched answer: the difference between a map and a filter is a map allows you to create an an entirely new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The map method allows items in an array to be manipulated to the user’s preference. the filter method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: The difference between a console.log() and a return is that a return is a statement at the end of a a function that executes the code from that function. Whereas a console.log() just allows you to run your code in the console.

  Researched answer: console.log is a function that logs the arguments you pass to the web console and it  lets us inspect values for debugging purposes. return is a statement which specifies the value returned from a function.  




4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is the data that you pass into the function.

  Researched answer: An argument is a value  passed as input to a function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: a proper paired programing technique will include a driver and a navigator. This technique puts the driver in charge of the coding and the task at hand while the navigator watches the driver executes each line of code, watching out for any mistakes and offering advice when needed. With this technique the driver and navigator can switch roles as often as they would like, usually a minimum of twenty min and no longer than an hour. in Another technique used for paired programming one person with write the test code while the other writes the code to be tested.

  Researched answer:

  Driver-navigator:This is the best known style of pairing. It consists of one person ‘driving’, taking the keyboard and coding or doing the work, while the other one is ‘navigating’. The Navigator’s job is to pay attention to the work being done by the driver while keeping the big picture in mind.
  Ping-pong: in ping-pong both people can be driving at any point in time. A good strategy for this approach is to have one person writing the tests while the other one tries to pass them. As in the previous approach, you should be switching roles often.
  Backseat Navigator: Like driver-navigator, the driver sits with his hands on the keyboard and executes the mechanics of typing and such.  But unlike driver-navigator, his partner dictates tactical instructions.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD stands for Test Driven development.  TDD is writing tests for your code ensuring the code is running properly, and efficiently. While practicing TDD you first create a test to run your code on, then you will run a failing test followed by a passing test.

  Researched answer: TDD stands for test driven development. TDD is a process for writing software that provably satisfies the software requirements. The work flow associated with TDD looks like this. First you Write a test to prove that the stated requirement is satisfied. Next you watch the test fail. This proves that the test won’t produce a false positive, and that the added code is what makes the test pass. After that you Add the implementation code and you watch the test pass. Finally you Look over the code and improve it, if necessary, relying on the test to prove that the improved code continues to work as expected.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: This week i found that Paired programming was very helpful. Learning what paired  is and practicing it everyday is a  helpful tool for my learning. Being partnered with someone and solving various problems together has created a more exciting, comforting learning environment.
